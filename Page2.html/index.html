    <p class="content">Peter Parker was an orphaned teenage boy who lived in Queens, New York with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben. He was a shy boy, but highly intelligent and excelled in science. He was often teased by other more popular kids like longtime nemesis Flash Thompson, but his life was soon to change on a visit to the science museum.
At the science museum, Peter was bitten by a radioactive spider. The spider bite gave Peter spider-like powers with super strength and reflexes. He also had a “spider-sense” alerting him to danger. Armed with these new powers, Peter first sought fame and money before fighting crime. He worked with a wrestling circuit and got some fame and appeared on a television show. During a robbery of the television show, Peter has the chance to stop the thief but chose not to.
 Peter later finds out that the same robber that he could have stopped at the television studio attempted to rob his aunt and uncle's residence, and his Uncle Ben was killed in the struggle. The words of his late uncle, "with great power there must also come great responsibility,” drive Peter to fight crime instead of chasing fame.</p>
